# Data Science & Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository provides implementations of fundamental data science statistical methods and machine learning algorithms.
I am more or less using this to facilitate my own learning.  In creating this, I will assume that there is a slight
knowledge of python and pandas.  Brief tutorials will be given.

This will be created mostly in Pyton and Jupyter Notebook.
